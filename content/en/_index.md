Sailor Hat for Raspberry Pi (SH-RPi for short) is a power management and NMEA 2000 interface board for the Raspberry Pi.
When connected to a Raspberry Pi single board computer (not included!), it allows you to build boat servers running [Signal K](https://signalk.org), [OpenPlotter](https://openmarine.net/openplotter), or your own custom IoT software and power them directly from the boat's 12V or 24V network and interface safely with the boat's NMEA 2000 data network.

To use the SH-RPi, you need to bring your own Raspberry Pi. All models supporting the 40-pin GPIO header (that is, every model since the Pi 1 Model B+) are supported.

Central use cases include:

- Safely power the computer using your boat's 12V or 24V power system.
SH-RPi has a wide voltage range (8-32V) power input with additional filtering and surge protection.
- Keep the server running during power glitches or brownouts.
The integrated supercapacitor ensures that intermittent power outages are totally ignored.
- Power even a Raspberry Pi 4B directly from the NMEA 2000 bus.
SH-RPi includes a current limiting circuit that limits the maximum input current to approximately 0.8A.
The supercapacitor provides ample peak power capability to run even power-hungry single-board computers with multiple peripheral devices such as a screen and an SSD drive.
- Shut the server down safely when the power is switched off.
The computer is informed about the power outage and the supercapacitor provides power while the computer shuts down in a controlled fashion. The supercapacitor is able to power a single Raspberry Pi 4B for up to 80 seconds, far more than the typical shutdown time of 10-15 seconds or less.
No more corrupted SD cards!
- Interface the Raspberry Pi with the boat's NMEA 2000 network or an automotive CAN bus.
SH-RPi includes an isolated NMEA 2000 interface that is compliant with the NMEA 2000 specification.
- Keep the computer in time with the optional integrated real-time clock and a backup battery.
- Reset the Raspberry Pi automatically if it has crashed.
- Stack other Raspberry Pi hats on top of SH-RPi to further add or customize the functionality.
SH-RPi has been designed to not interfere with other devices using the SPI data interface.
- Don't disturb other boat navigation and safety systems.
SH-RPi complies with the relevant European and maritime electromagnetic compatibility standards, ensuring that the device does not interfere with other sensitive devices such as the VHF radio or the GPS.
