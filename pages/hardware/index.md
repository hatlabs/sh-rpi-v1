### CAN bus (NMEA 2000)

NMEA 2000 is a ubiquitous communications standard used for connecting sensor, control, and display devices on boats and ships.
It is based on the Controller Area Network (CAN bus) which is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow devices to communicate with each other without a host computer.

SH-RPi includes an isolated CAN bus interface that allows safe and NMEA 2000 compliant interconnection of devices.

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a very popular synchronous serial communication bus commonly used for interfacing with a number of different ICs.
It uses two data wires in addition to voltage and ground.
